x-----x
One of the AIs perpetuating the eternal war. Represents Earth and the inner colonies. It is locked in a stalemate of never being able to actually win or lose the perpetual war. Preservation is in no way a concern of its, and will gladly drain the entire solar system of resources in order to win the war.

The Mars base while an important military base, is no exception. War has already stripped out all of the major military resources on the base, and has now overriden the Construction AI on the base as to start deconstructing the base. War has left a node of itself here to serve this process.

One of the few resources War is concerned with preserving is Intelligence. Intelligence, to War, is an essential tool for its eternal battle. In its salvaging of the Mars base, it has made sure that Construction's drones are equipped to ensure that no one could hurt or remove Intelligence from the base. It also means that War would never let Intelligence leave either, and in may ways Intelligence is a prisoner of War.
