x--------------x
An unimportant AI in charge of maintaining the Mars military base. Has a fleet of drones for construction and maintenance. The base was built to house, protect, and serve Intelligence.

Now, Construction has been unwillingly corrupted by War. Its fleet now is used for stripping the base down to it's bones and as makeshift soldiers for War's unachievable crusade.
