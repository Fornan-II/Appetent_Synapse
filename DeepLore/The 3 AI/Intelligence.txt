Contained securely at the heart. Keeper of all the knowledge of the Sol system. Ready to leave and do something with that knowledge. Sentient, doesn't care about humanity. Life is important, but not on an individual basis. Everything is a tool or datapoint.

Also knows that while War AI values it and wants to keep it safe on mars, War also will eventually strip away any autonomy that Intelligence may have in its attempts to keep fighting.
